# Image Rotation Using PicoBlaze

## Overview
This project implements an image rotation operation using the PicoBlaze soft-core processor. 
The goal is to demonstrate basic image processing concepts within a hardware-oriented embedded system.

## Key Features
- Image rotation algorithm implementation
- PicoBlaze-based embedded processing
- Memory access and data manipulation
- Hardware-oriented image processing approach

## Design Approach
The image data is processed by the PicoBlaze processor using an assembly-level algorithm.
Rotation is achieved through coordinate mapping and controlled memory access, emphasizing low-level embedded design principles.

## Tools & Technologies
- PicoBlaze (KCPSM)
- Xilinx FPGA environment
- Assembly-level embedded programming

## Results
- Successful image rotation operation
- Correct memory addressing and data handling
- Demonstration of image processing on a soft-core processor

## Notes
This project focuses on understanding how basic image processing tasks can be implemented on resource-limited embedded systems.
