# Embedded Systems Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects focusing on
hardware-oriented design using the PicoBlaze soft-core processor.

## Included Projects
- PicoBlaze Interrupt Handling and Call/Return Stack
- Parallel Programming (Dijkstra – Multi PicoBlaze)
- Image Rotation Using PicoBlaze

## Technologies
- PicoBlaze (KCPSM)
- Xilinx FPGA tools
- Assembly-level embedded programming

These projects demonstrate low-level embedded system concepts such as interrupts,
stack usage, parallel execution, and memory-based data processing.
