# PicoBlaze Interrupt Handling and Call/Return Stack

## Overview
This project demonstrates interrupt handling and call/return stack behavior in the PicoBlaze soft-core processor.

## Key Features
- Interrupt-driven execution
- Call/Return stack usage
- Nested interrupt handling
- Hardware-oriented embedded design

## Design Approach
The design focuses on understanding how PicoBlaze handles interrupts and manages the call/return stack during nested function calls and interrupt servicing.

## Tools & Technologies
- PicoBlaze (KCPSM)
- Xilinx FPGA environment
- Assembly-level embedded programming

## Notes
This project emphasizes low-level embedded concepts such as interrupt control and stack behavior rather than high-level application logic.
