# Parallel Programming Using Dijkstra Algorithm (Multi PicoBlaze)

## Overview
This project implements a parallel programming approach using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm on a multi PicoBlaze architecture.

## Key Features
- Parallel execution using multiple PicoBlaze cores
- Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
- Hardware-oriented task distribution
- Embedded system level design approach

## Design Approach
The system distributes computation tasks across multiple PicoBlaze processors to demonstrate parallel execution.  
The focus is on understanding how algorithm-level parallelism can be mapped onto a hardware-oriented embedded architecture.

## Tools & Technologies
- PicoBlaze (KCPSM)
- Xilinx FPGA environment
- Assembly-level embedded programming

## Results
- Successful parallel execution of the Dijkstra algorithm
- Improved task separation across processing units
- Demonstration of algorithm-to-hardware mapping

## Notes
This project emphasizes parallel thinking and system-level embedded design rather than software-only algorithm implementation.
